# PDF Summarization App using GPT-2
This project is a Python-based application that extracts text from PDF files and generates summaries using the GPT-2 model from Hugging Face's transformers library. The summaries are saved in a text file for easy access.

## Features
* Extracts text from PDF files.
* Summarizes large chunks of text using GPT-2.
* Saves the summary in a separate .txt file.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

Python 3.8+
PyPDF2 for extracting text from PDFs
transformers for loading the GPT-2 model
torch for running GPT-2 model
PyTorch (see PyTorch installation guide)

You can install the necessary dependencies using pip:

$ pip install PyPDF2 transformers torch $
